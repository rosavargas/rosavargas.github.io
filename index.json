However, he was fascinated by and contributed to an unusually wide breadth of research in physics and biophysics, based on long-term and enthusiastic collaborations with leading experts in each area.\nHis thesis and early work, until the mid 1980s, focused on nonlinear effects in guided modes in water waves and other geophysical fluid systems. In the 1990s his attention turned to solitons and coherent structures, and in the last 15 years this work linked with the study of optical solitons in nonlocal systems, particularly nematic liquid crystals. In collaboration with G. Assanto of the University of Rome “Roma Tre” and N. F. Smyth of the University of Edinburgh, Tim developed an analytical theory of optical soliton propagation in liquid crystals which proved to be valid in experimental regimes. A key to this understanding was the use of asymptotic analysis to incorporate the radiation shed as the solitons evolve.\nExtracted from the journal Physics Today, People \u0026amp; History\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"258fce11078224ee0cb38c412b57f38d","permalink":"/author/a.-a.-minzoni/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/a.-a.-minzoni/","section":"authors","summary":"Antonmaria “Tim” Alessio Minzoni passed away on the 1 July 2017.

Our goal is to compare semi-analytic normal mode solutions known in the literature for special triangular cross-sections to numerical solutions obtained using approximations of the non-local Dirichlet–Neumann operator for linear waves, specifically an ad-hoc approximation proposed in [Vargas-Magaña and Panayotaros](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165212516300336?via%3Dihub), and a first-order truncation of the systematic depth expansion by Craig et al. We consider cases of transverse (i.e. 2-D) modes and longitudinal modes, i.e. 3-D modes with sinusoidal dependence in the longitudinal direction. The triangular geometries considered have slopping beach boundaries that should in principle limit the applicability of the approximate Dirichlet–Neumann operators. We nevertheless see that the approximate operators give remarkably close results for transverse even modes, while for odd transverse modes we have some discrepancies near the boundary. In the case of longitudinal modes, where the theory only yields even modes, the different approximate operators show more discrepancies for the first two longitudinal modes and better agreement for higher modes. The ad-hoc approximation is generally closer to exact modes away from the boundary.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Linear Modes for Channels of Constant Cross- Section and Approximate DirichletNeumann Operators","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rosa Maria Vargas Magaña","Panayotaros P."],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

However, he was fascinated by and contributed to an unusually wide breadth of research in physics and biophysics, based on long-term and enthusiastic collaborations with leading experts in each area.\nHis thesis and early work, until the mid 1980s, focused on nonlinear effects in guided modes in water waves and other geophysical fluid systems. In the 1990s his attention turned to solitons and coherent structures, and in the last 15 years this work linked with the study of optical solitons in nonlocal systems, particularly nematic liquid crystals. In collaboration with G. Assanto of the University of Rome “Roma Tre” and N. F. Smyth of the University of Edinburgh, Tim developed an analytical theory of optical soliton propagation in liquid crystals which proved to be valid in experimental regimes. A key to this understanding was the use of asymptotic analysis to incorporate the radiation shed as the solitons evolve.\nExtracted from the journal Physics Today, People \u0026amp; History\n","date":1527811200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1527811200,"objectID":"258fce11078224ee0cb38c412b57f38d","permalink":"/author/a.-a.-minzoni/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/a.-a.-minzoni/","section":"authors","summary":"Antonmaria “Tim” Alessio Minzoni passed away on the 1 July 2017.

Por tal motivo, los gobiernos de todo el mundo deben tomar decisiones difíciles, cuyas consecuencias impactan la forma de vida de las personas. Ellos deben equilibrar entre el riesgo a la salud y el daño a la economía.\nLo que nos permitirá regresar a la forma de vida lo más cercana posible a como la conocíamos antes de esta pandemia será lograr que un alto porcentaje de la población genere inmunidad contra el virus. Esto se puede lograr por dos vías:\n Dejar que la enfermedad se propague libremente hasta que eventualmente un 80% de la población que sobreviva la haya padecido y superado. Inducir inmunidad a ese porcentaje de la población por medio de una vacuna.  Dado que los efectos de la enfermedad en la población de riesgo son devastadores, la vía de la inmunidad por medio de vacunas es la más ética. En ese sentido, es crucial evitar las reacciones secundarias para la población, con lo cual se garantice que los efectos negativos sean menores que la exposición al virus. Por lo mismo, desarrollar vacunas es un proceso laborioso, complejo y tardado.\nEl desarrollo de vacunas consta de dos partes, la fase preclínica (experimentos en células, tejidos y modelos animales) y la fase clínica (ensayos en humanos).\nLa fase clínica involucra 5 fases de investigación:\nPREFASE I: Fase utilizada para describir los ensayos exploratorios realizados antes de los ensayos tradicionales de fase 1, para investigar si afectan al organismo y de qué forma. Implica una exposición humana muy limitada y no tiene objetivos terapéuticos.\nFASE I: Se enfoca en la seguridad de la vacuna. Se prueba en un número pequeño de voluntarios saludables. Se determinan los efectos no deseados más severos y cómo se metaboliza y elimina del cuerpo.\nFASE II: En esta fase se reúnen datos preliminares de cómo trabaja la vacuna en personas que tienen ciertas enfermedades o condiciones de salud.\nFASE III: Fase en donde se describen ensayos clínicos que recopilan más información sobre la seguridad y efectividad mediante el estudio del efecto en diferentes poblaciones, diferentes dosis y al usarse en combinación con otros medicamentos. Estos estudios generalmente involucran un número mayor de participantes.\nFASE IV: En esta fase se describen los estudios realizados después de que se ha aprobado para su comercialización. Estos estudios recopilan información sobre la seguridad, eficacia o uso óptimo. Además, incluyen requisitos de posventa y compromisos que son requeridos y acordados por el patrocinador del estudio.\nPara la enfermedad COVID-19, las vacunas candidatas más adelantadas al momento se encuentran en las fases I o II.

El mayor riesgo de transmisión de enfermedades zoonóticas se produce en la interfaz entre el ser humano y los animales a través de la exposición directa o indirecta a los animales, los productos derivados de estos (carne, leche, huevos, etc) o su entorno.\nSegún el Programa de Naciones Unidas para el Medio Ambiente, el 60% de las enfermedades infecciosas humanas tiene origen animal. Este porcentaje alcanza el 75% en el caso de las enfermedades llamadas “emergentes”, por ejemplos: ébola, VIH, gripes aviarias, SRAS, zika y ahora el Covid-19.\nEl virus SARS-CoV-2, causante de la enfermedad COVID-19, tiene un 96% de semejanza con el virus RaTG13, que infecta a la especie de murciélago Rhinolophus affinis. Esta no sería la primera vez que una enfermedad causada por un virus de la familia de los coronavirus ocurre a través de transferencia zoonótica. Las epidemias de SARS en el 2002 y de MERS en 2012, tuvieron su origen en cepas de virus que también infectan a los murciélagos y que usaron como intermediarios a otros animales como la civeta y al camello.\nLa emergencia de enfermedades zoonóticas se facilita enormemente por la constante interacción entre las especies y el desequilibrio de su entorno, lo que causa “puentes” para llegar a los humanos. Esta interacción está mediada entre otras cosas por la destrucción de su hábitat (deforestación, agricultura, urbanización), el tráfico irregular de fauna silvestre y la explotación animal desmedida.\nLa emergencia de enfermedades zoonóticas se facilita enormemente por la constante interacción entre las especies y el desequilibrio de su entorno, lo que causa “puentes” para llegar a los humanos.

Somos dos grupos que trabajamos en colaboración, el colectivo de Científicos Mexicanos en el extranjero y el grupo ConCiencia Social: Laboratorio Científico, Social y de Políticas Públicas (ver miembros al final de la nota). Conformamos un grupo multidisciplinario que nos encontramos en diferentes países, por supuesto México, España, Reino Unido, Portugal, Austria, Italia, Francia y Estados Unidos de América (EUA).\nContexto Estamos viviendo una pandemia provocada por el virus COVID-19 cuyo primer brote se detectó en la provincia de Hubei en China, marcando el día cero de este brote por un nuevo coronavirus el día 19 de enero de 2020 con 216 infectados. Desde entonces el virus COVID-19 se ha propagado a nivel internacional lo que ha ocasionado que al día de hoy se tengan registrado brotes de COVID-19 en 178 países. La intensidad y evolución de cada brote epidémico ha variado en cada localidad como lo manifiestan las curvas de infectados, recuperados y defunciones, que podemos consultar en la red de forma actualizada y confiable como lo es el repositorio de la universidad Johns Hopkins University. Además de múltiples bases de datos disponibles, en partular la que usamos para este trabajo sobre las medidas de control que los diversos gobiernos han implementado con fechas actualizadas y que es elaborada por la universidad de Oxford \u0026ndash; Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker.\nPlanteamiento original y motivación Hemos seguido de cerca y experimentado directamente las medidas de control que han sido implementadas en los diferentes países en donde nos encontramos además de haber analizado el caso de China y podemos percatarnos de los diferentes binomios (medidas de control, mitigación del brote) que han sido implementados con mayor o menor éxito en los distintos países.\nEl planteamiento que nos hicimos fue analizar la viabilidad de implementar un modelo matemático y una metodología que nos permitiera dar pautas a la sociedad mexicana en estos momentos y responder con base en parámetros medibles si estas medidas son útiles y eficientes para contener y mitigar el brote epidémico. Resultando que nuestro modelo es capaz de responder un con un contundente SÍ, las medidas de control diseñadas e implementadas en este momento y en este estadio de la epidemia si tuvieron y tendrán un efecto en el periodo de la evolución del brote epidémico.\nConcretamente nuestros objetivos son:  Mostrar comportamiento decreciente de la tasa de contagio efectiva medida en los diferentes países analizados después de un periodo de haber aplicado las medidas de control. Mostrar que la efectividad de estas medidas depende tanto del orden y la temporalidad dentro de las etapas del brote, así como de la severidad con las que fueron aplicadas y la duración de las mismas. Resaltar que la elaboración de una estrategia adecuada a cada país para la implementación de estas medidas es crucial para la contención y mitigación del brote epidémico.  Modelo matemático SIR La base de este trabajo es un modelo clásico de 1927 ideado por los médicos escoceses W. O. Kermack y A. G. McKendrick, el cual emplea un sistema de ecuaciones diferenciales a fin de detallar cómo surge un brote infeccioso, su crecimiento, en qué momento alcanza su máximo y cómo después decae, todo ello a partir de dos parámetros: uno biológico \\gamma y otro social \\beta:\n  Parámetro \\gamma: Es un parámetro biológico que está relacionado con el número de días en que tarda un humano infectado en recuperarse y es contagioso.\n  Parámetro \\beta: Es un parámetro social que considera cómo se transmite el COVID-19 y cómo puedes disminuir su contagio implementando medidas de control de diferente corte que ayuden a modificar y limitar la interacción entre humanos.\n  Estas medidas son de una gama muy amplia que van desde medidas que no frenan la actividad laboral y social en las ciudades, como por ejemplo: incluir hábitos higiénicos como el lavado de manos y el no tocarse la cara, la limpieza de superficies y hábitos de interacción social como la sana distancia entre las personas, hasta las medidas más restrictivas y severas que impactan en el desarrollo laboral y de restricciones en la movilidad de la sociedad, como por ejemplo lo es el aislamiento en determinados casos, hacer home office, entre otras y las que se incluyen en una etapa más avanzada de la epidemia como por ejemplo: cierre de centros de trabajo no esenciales y cuarentena prolongada. Además, dentro de esta gama de medidas están las de corte monetario y fiscal que son muy necesarias en un brote de larga duración para proteger a la población más desprotegida. Recordemos que México es un país que debe enfrentar la Contingencia Covid-19 en las condiciones adversas con el 50% de su población en la pobreza, no bancarizada y con un sistema de salud precario.\nEl modelo depende igualmente de la población total, y de ciertos valores iniciales que son el número inicial de infectados, de defunciones y de recuperados al día cero del brote. El modelo predice el número de personas infectadas y recuperados a diferentes tiempos.\nEl modelo anterior también conocido como modelo SIR es adecuado para analizar este tipo de brotes epidémicos ya que describe a un buen nivel de precisión la evolución de un brote provocado por un nuevo virus en una región. Es un modelo simplificado respecto al número de parámetros que utiliza, son sólo dos parámetros \\beta y \\gamma con una clara interpretación. Otra ventaja de usar un modelo simplificado es para una correcta y efectiva implementación de la metodología que se usa para el ajuste de parámetros a lo largo de diferentes periodos del brote que puede ser aplicada a múltiples países.\nAdemás, este modelo fue utilizado en el 2009 para modelar el brote epidémico de la influenza H1N1 en la Ciudad de México y aplicar medidas de control efectivas para mitigar el brote, el artículo puede consultarse en: Modelling of the influenza A(H1N1) outbreak in Mexico City, April-May 2009, with control sanitary measures de los autores G Cruz-Pacheco et al.\nMetodología del Ajuste con intervalos variables Un modelo estático no nos sirve para estudiar la evolución de la epidemia, dado que la mayoría de los países han implementado medidas de mitigación, entonces podemos esperar que la evolución tenga una tasa efectiva de contagio que varía en el tiempo y en particular esperamos que disminuya en el tiempo. Lo que hicimos fue ajustar el modelo variando el intervalo de tiempo del ajuste para poder identificar si las medidas han tenido impacto en la tasa de contagio efectiva. Realizamos este procedimiento por el número de intervalos de tiempo que nos indique nuestros datos.\nDescripción técnica de la metodología: A fin de ajustar el modelo sobre los datos, usamos una minimización del estimador de \\Xi^2 cuadrado asociado a uno algoritmo de optimización siguiendo el método de Powell. Este método no requiere que nuestro estimador sea diferenciable al contrario de un método de gradiente. En nuestro caso preciso no hay manera de definir correctamente la matriz de covarianza razón por la cual usamos una matriz unitaria. Elegimos esta convención para no dar más importancia a datos particulares pudiendo sesgar el valor de los parámetros estimados. Sin embargo, por esta misma razón no podemos extraer el error de los parámetros estimados sino enfocarnos en el valor de mayor verosimilitud.\nDescripción de la metodología aplicada a cada país y visualización de los plots: Para entender la metodología podemos imaginar un caso hipotético donde una epidemia empieza en un país y el gobierno no aplica ninguna medida de mitigación, entonces la epidemia seguirá su desarrollo natural determinado únicamente por beta y gama. Lo que podemos hacer en este caso es ajustar el modelo y medir o determinar el valor del parámetro beta que mejor ajusta los datos, un buen ajuste implicaría que nuestra predicción del modelo y observación son muy similares o idénticas.\nUna vez que encontramos el modelo que mejor describe nuestras observaciones podemos evaluar cómo evolucionará la infección con el tiempo. Entonces, lo que ocurriría es que en un breve tiempo se afectaría un porcentaje importante de la población. Sabemos hoy que la tasa de enfermos que requieren hospitalización es aproximadamente 10% y la tasa de mortalidad es de 4-5%. Este caso ideal no toma en cuenta las condiciones del sistema de salud, entonces supone que sin importar el número de enfermos los hospitales podrán atenderlos. Si suponemos que el sistema de salud solo puede atender un número limitado de enfermos, entonces se habla de saturación del sistema de salud e incremento de la tasa de mortalidad. Por tanto el interés de los gobiernos por implementar medidas de mitigación para intentar reducir la tasa de contagio y por ende el número de pacientes que requerirán atención hospitalaria y de cuidados intensivos al mismo tiempo y de esta forma administrar los recurso de salud de manera óptima.\nEste análisis fue aplicado para 5 países: China, Italia, España, Reino Unido, Estados Unidos y México. Para poder asociar los cambios en la tasa de contagio con las medidas de mitigación realizamos una investigación de las fechas y medidas de mitigación implementadas, así como la efectividad y severidad de las medidas en los diferentes paises. En particular nos centramos en analizar el impacto en el parámetro beta, de las estrategias de mitigación seguidas en los diferentes países y esperamos que entre más efectivas las medidas, más baja sea la tasa de contagio.\nLimitaciones del modelo El modelo no integra una dimensión espacial y considera que la propagación del brote es homogénea. Entonces en los casos donde una ciudad o unas cuantas ciudades tienen un brote de distinta intensidad y temporalidad, la interpretación del modelo será un promedio de los efectos de cada uno de los brotes en las ciudades, lo que llamamos tasa de contagio efectiva.\nDatos Los datos los extraemos del siguiente repositorio:\n https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19\nEste es un repositorio creado desde 2019 para el “Nuevo panel visual de coronavirus (Novel Coronavirus Visual Dashboard)” que es operado por the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science y Engineering (JHU CSSE). Esta base es actualizada por el Equipo ESRI Living Atlas y el Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab (JHU APL). Las condiciones iniciales y el periodo de aplicación del modelo fueron determinados mediante los datos reportados de cada país. Se considero el día cero de la epidemia en cada país como el día en que el acumulado de infectados rebaso la cifra de 100 infectados.\nResultados Este análisis fue aplicado para 5 países: China, Italia, España, Reino Unido, Estados Unidos y México. Para poder asociar los cambios en la tasa de contagio con las medidas de mitigación realizamos una investigación de las fechas y medidas de mitigación implementadas, así como la efectividad y severidad de las medidas en los diferentes países. En particular nos centramos en analizar el impacto en el parámetro beta, de las estrategias de mitigación seguidas en los diferentes países y esperamos que entre más efectivas las medidas, más baja sea la tasa de contagio.\nChina Figura: Análisis sobre el impacto de las medidas de control implementadas en CHINA para tratar de mitigar el brote epidémico COVID-19.\nEl brote epidémico en China fue detectado y declarado el 19 de enero con 216 casos confirmados. Debido a que el brote se encontraba ya en una fase de crecimiento acelerado, se implementaron medidas de control muy severas a nivel regional en toda la provincia de Hubei.\nLas medidas adoptadas a nivel regional permitieron mitigar la intensidad del brote inicial. Particularmente, al día 10 del inicio del brote se observa un pequeño decrecimiento en la tasa de contagio. Las medidas de control no se relajaron durante los próximos 30 días. Este efecto de las medidas puede apreciarse en que los valores de beta decrecen conforme pasa el tiempo y que el efecto de “aplanamiento” se observa en los escenarios evolutivos de la epidemia por el modelo SIR. Observamos que la aplicación contundente y efectiva de las diferentes medidas de control en la región del brote (y algunas otras preventivas a nivel nacional) ayudaron a concentrar y frenar el brote epidémico, y por ello no fue necesario extender estas mismas medidas a nivel nacional.\nChina implementó una estrategia efectiva para mitigar el brote de COVID19 y mantenerlo en la región de Hubei por un tiempo prolongado, suficiente para que no fuera propagado en el resto del país, donde el balance final de defunciones a la fecha es de 3,316.\nItalia Figura: Análisis sobre el impacto de las medidas de control implementadas en ITALIA para tratar de mitigar el brote epidémico COVID-19.\nItalia fue el primer país en presentar un brote de gran intensidad en Europa, brote que lamentablemente a la fecha sigue su curso costando muchas vidas en su población y un golpe terrible a los trabajadores de la salud en donde su capacidad hospitalaria y de atención fue rebasada en la fase de crecimiento acelerado del brote.\nItalia detectó el inicio del brote el día 24 de Febrero con 132 casos confirmados en su mayoría localizados en la Región de Lombardía. No fueron aplicadas mayores medidas de control para contener o mitigar el brote previamente a excepción de controles de viajes internacionales de corte severo al día 30 de enero, tampoco hubo campaña de información previa. Se observa que las medidas de control comienzan a ser implementadas el día 4 de marzo, 8 días después del día declarado como el inicio de la epidemia en la fase de crecimiento rápido de la epidemia y no son de corte severas en la región del brote sino más bien son de carácter relajado y gradual, por tanto podemos esperar que el impacto de las medidas sea mucho menor que en China. Los resultados verifican la intuición y encontramos que la tasa de contacto que podemos extraer de los datos en distintos periodos del brote ha decrecido más lentamente por ende el brote está teniendo una duración más larga en comparación con China y también se han registrado un mayor número de muertes, siendo el 19 de marzo el día en que lamentablemente Italia superó el número de defunciones por Covid19 que hasta el momento había reportado china esto ocurre a los 19 días del inicio del brote en Italia. El caso de Italia es importante pues es el primer país en describir una evolución a un escenario muy difícil en donde se supera el punto de la capacidad del sistema de salud, esto es la saturación de los sistemas de salud que igualmente aumentan la tasa de mortalidad y a la fecha Italia ha presentado 12 428 muertes. Por el momento no hemos incluido análisis de esta componente del fenómeno pero es algo que potencialmente integraremos al análisis.\nEspaña Figura: Análisis sobre el impacto de las medidas de control implementadas en ESPAÑA para tratar de mitigar el brote epidémico COVID-19.\nEspaña es otro país que hemos incluido en el estudio, pues nuevamente el binomio (medidas de control, mitigación de la curva de infectados) es muy interesante. España detectó el brote epidémico el 3 de marzo con 114 infectados. La única medida de control, efectuada previamente al brote, fue una campaña de información con poca difusión. El día 9 de marzo con 589 contagios es que se aplicaron medidas de control regionales (Nivel 1) y el 10 de marzo con 4231 infectados es que se aplican acciones muy severas en todo el país. El impacto que estas acciones tuvieron en la curva de infectados, se vieron reflejadas desde el día 15 de marzo, luego el día 21 de marzo y finalmente el día 28 de marzo en donde claramente observamos una inflexión en la curva y el parámetro beta de tasa de contacto efectiva medido pasó de 0.42 a 0.29, 0.26 y 0.17 respectivamente. Al día 6 de abril se han registrado lamentablemente 11,198 defunciones. El 26 de marzo, España superó a CHINA en el número de defunciones por COVID-19. Esto es a los 20 días del inicio del brote.\nDe lo anterior podemos inferir que las medidas de control atendidas por la sociedad española están logrando mitigar el brote de COVID-19. Esperamos que de no relajarse las medidas y con la obediencia y solidaridad de todos los españoles logren que finalmente el brote empiece su fase de declive.\nEspaña ha librado una difícil batalla contra el COVID-19, su población tuvo que aprender a la mala como combatir la transmisión del virus y lograr mitigar el brote en una fase difícil. Respetar la sana distancia, convencerse de la relevancia del confinamiento en un principo y de la importancia de mantener el correcto lavado de manos y el uso correct del alcohol en gel fue difícil. Ha sido una curva de aprendizaje dura y que ha costado muchas vidas y grandes esfuerzos principalmente de su cuerpo de salud pero finalmente la sociedad española ha aprendido.\nEstados Unidos Figura: Análisis sobre el impacto de las medidas de control implementadas en EUA para tratar de mitigar el brote epidémico COVID-19.\nCon respecto a Estados Unidos, lo que observamos del análisis es que no se ha observado disminución de la tasa de contagio a los 21 días de haber iniciado el brote. Lo que indica que las medidas de control se aplicaron de manera muy tardía en el brote y no han tenido ningún efecto en la tasa de contacto. El país se encuentra en un momento de crecimiento acelerado del número de infectados y la ausencia de medidas severas homogéneas o coherentes a lo largo del país para la contención de la epidemia parecen apuntar a que la tasa de contacto no tendrá cambios significativos en las semanas próximas. Características de estados Unidos que deben tomarse en cuenta al realizar el análisis es su gran conectividad, su población relativamente grande, y la ausencia de medidas coherentes a lo largo del país de contención de la epidemia, que se han presentado múltiples brotes en el país, sobre todo en toda la costa este y en California lo cual no permite que podamos asumir una evolución homogénea por lo que pensamos hacer en el futuro análisis regionales.\n[Trabajo en progreso \u0026hellip;]\nMéxico Figuras: Análisis sobre el impacto de las medidas de control implementadas en MÉXICO para tratar de mitigar el brote epidémico COVID-19.\nEn México en contraste con el resto de países que hemos analizado hasta el momento como son China, Italia, España, Reino Unido, Estados Unidos, demuestra haber preparado una estrategia con suficiente antelación ante la llegada del brote de COVID-19 al país y considerando las condiciones con las cuales debía hacer frente a la epidemia, contemplando indudablemente las características sociales, económicas y de su sistema de salud.\nDiseñó muy bien una estrategia definida por Fase 1, 2 y 3. Dando inicio a la Fase 1 el día 23 de Enero , esto es 56 días antes del inicio del brote. Todas las medidas definidas e implementadas en la Fase 1 repercutieron positivamente para lograr mitigar la intensidad del brote esto, de acuerdo al los datos arrojados por el estudio lo podemos identificar en que el ajuste del parámetro de contacto efectivo es de beta=0.3 al inicio del brote, el cual es mucho menor al beta=0.4 reportado en las mediciones en China Italia y España. Al día 9-10 del inicio del brote comienza a vislumbrarse una inflexión en la curva a un estado de menor crecimiento y su evolución responderá al impacto del correcto comportamiento de la ciudadanía y gobierno para acatar las medidas impuestas en fase 2.\nCon la evolución a un mayor número de días será posible medir el impacto de las medidas implementadas por la secretaría de salud y gobierno del día 24 de marzo con el inicio de la fase 2 y el día 30 de marzo con el cierre de centros de trabajo no esenciales. Se puede esperar que si la ciudadanía sigue las recomendaciones la tasa de contacto será mucho menor a 0.3 de no relajarse las medidas y aplicarse por el tiempo estimado por la secretaría de salud y gobierno.\nConsideramos que México ha diseñado una estrategia y se ha anticipado adecuadamente a la llegada del brote, iniciando una fuerte campaña de información 8 semanas previas al inicio del mismo. Se han difundido oportunamente recomendaciones sanitarias que incluyen medidas de higiene y de la jornada de sana distancia para disminuir la transmisión del virus. Además, las medidas más severas de limitación de la movilidad han sido aplicadas oportunamente en la fase previa al inicio del crecimiento acelerado del brote, también ya en la fase de crecimiento acelerado se han anunciado nuevas medidas que incluyen el cierre de centros de trabajo no esenciales hasta el 30 de abril. Podemos esperar que si no se relajan estas medidas y son adoptadas por la mayoría de los habitantes del país se logre reducir sustancialmente la tasa de contagio efectiva en las próximas semanas. Esta semana será clave para valorar el impacto de las medidas pero los resultados preliminares parecen prometedores. En la figura mostramos dos proyecciones en 2 escenarios diferentes un escenario donde se tiene una mitigación efectiva que seguiría la trayectoria de países como China y un escenario menos prometedor donde la tasa de contagio decrece como Italia. Estas predicciones también las iremos actualizando.\nColaboradores en este trabajo Coordinadores: Rosa María Vargas-Magaña (U. de Edimburgo), Sebastien Fromenteau (ICF-UNAM), Mariana Vargas-Magaña (IF-UNAM), Adán José-García y Jesús Misráyim Rueda Becerril.\nLaboratorio ConCiencia Social: Rosa María Vargas-Magaña, Sebastien Fromenteau, Mariana Vargas Magaña, German Vargas Magaña, Monica Bocanegra, Germán Vargas Larios, Rosa María Magaña Álvarez.\nColectivo Científicos Mexicanos en el Extranjero: Adán José-García, Andrea Elizabeth Gutiérrez Quezada, María Abigail Jiménez Franco, Abril Armenta Franco, Adriana Azucena Cortés Gómez, Francisco Cuéllar Pérez, Jesús Misráyim Rueda Becerril, Marcela Martin del Campo Fierro, Nelly Arcos Martínez.\n","date":1586044800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586044800,"objectID":"9e0e25e29f3e7772aed1bbed6297a727","permalink":"/post/covid19/","publishdate":"2020-04-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/covid19/","section":"post","summary":"Impacto de las medidas de control implementadas para mitigar del brote epidémico del COVID-19","tags":["COVID19","coronavirus","México"],"title":"Medidas de control ante el brote COVID-19 y su impacto en la evolución del brote epidémico","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1572134400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572134400,"objectID":"177d76aedb5daf8731ff7466a4872f94","permalink":"/project/concienciaslab/","publishdate":"2019-10-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/concienciaslab/","section":"project","summary":"Somos un grupo compuesto por investigadores de ciencias exactas y humanistas.

Our goal is to compare semi-analytic normal mode solutions known in the literature for special triangular cross-sections to numerical solutions obtained using approximations of the non-local Dirichlet–Neumann operator for linear waves, specifically an ad-hoc approximation proposed in [Vargas-Magaña and Panayotaros](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165212516300336?via%3Dihub), and a first-order truncation of the systematic depth expansion by Craig et al. We consider cases of transverse (i.e. 2-D) modes and longitudinal modes, i.e. 3-D modes with sinusoidal dependence in the longitudinal direction. The triangular geometries considered have slopping beach boundaries that should in principle limit the applicability of the approximate Dirichlet–Neumann operators. We nevertheless see that the approximate operators give remarkably close results for transverse even modes, while for odd transverse modes we have some discrepancies near the boundary. In the case of longitudinal modes, where the theory only yields even modes, the different approximate operators show more discrepancies for the first two longitudinal modes and better agreement for higher modes. The ad-hoc approximation is generally closer to exact modes away from the boundary.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Linear Modes for Channels of Constant Cross- Section and Approximate DirichletNeumann Operators","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rosa Maria Vargas Magaña","P.

[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the School of Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh working on the project Numerical and analytical study of undular bores governed by the full water wave equations and bi-directional Whitham-Boussinesq equations in collaboration with Prof. Noel Smyth and Prof. Timothy Marchant. My main research interests are nonlinear dispersive equations, with a focus on water waves. Before joining University Edinburgh, I was a Craig Huneke postdoctoral fellow at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute in Berkeley, California, attending the research program Hamiltonian systems, from topology to applications through analysis program during the Fall 2018 semester.\nI obtained my Ph.D. from the Mathematics and Mechanics Department at the Applied Mathematics Institute (IIMAS) at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, in 2017, working on non-local shallow water wave models over variable topography under the supervision of Dr.Panayotis Panayotaros In my doctoral dissertation, I proposed a Hamiltonian non-local shallow water wave model for flow over variable topography using the Hamiltonian formulation of the free surface potential flow introduced by Zakharov-Craig-Sulem.\n","date":1554595200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1554595200,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/author/rosa-maria-vargas-magana/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/rosa-maria-vargas-magana/","section":"authors","summary":"I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the School of Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh working on the project Numerical and analytical study of undular bores governed by the full water wave equations and bi-directional Whitham-Boussinesq equations in collaboration with Prof.","tags":null,"title":"Rosa Maria Vargas Magaña","type":"authors"},{"authors":["Rosa Maria Vargas Magaña"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Slides button above to demo Academic\u0026rsquo;s Markdown slides feature.
